<section id="bio">
  <p> When I was small, I didn't have any interest in playing badminton as I could not hit the shuttle even after many trys. Then,when I was 10 years old, my mother who is a doctor, her assistant called and asked her that she and her friends were going to the badminton court and that I could also come if I'd like to and I said "Yes!". When I reached there with Mandip (one of the maid)for company, they shared their rackets with us. They taught me to play badminton and I really liked it. After 3-4 days I was an expert and won every match we had. </p>

   <p> Now, I am really good at playing badminton. I want to learn more and get perfect so I have decided to practice almost everyday. When I am an adult, I want to become as good as Saina Nehwal in playing this sport. I love to play badminton.</p>
